Here’s an expanded and refined explanation for each of the key concepts, tailored to help you explain them in your presentation slides. I’ll include both background information and questions you might consider to guide the audience’s understanding.

Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

What is Local Outlier Factor (LOF)?
	•	Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is an anomaly detection algorithm that identifies outliers based on the local density around each data point. Unlike global methods, LOF focuses on a point’s local neighborhood, making it especially useful in data where density varies.

How Does LOF Work?
	1.	Local Density Comparison: LOF measures the density of a point’s neighborhood by calculating distances to its nearest neighbors.
	2.	Outlier Score: It assigns an LOF score to each point. If a point’s density is much lower than that of its neighbors, it’s flagged as an outlier. Typically, scores above 1 indicate outliers.
	3.	Adaptive to Local Variations: LOF performs well in datasets with variable densities, as it adapts to local density changes rather than applying a single threshold across the entire dataset.

Why Use LOF for Our Model?
	•	In financial reports, certain years might contain unique language due to unusual events (e.g., lawsuits). LOF helps identify these years as outliers by spotting deviations in language and structure within the context of similar years.

Guiding Questions for the Audience:
	•	Why is it important to consider local density rather than a global threshold when detecting outliers?
	•	How could changes in a bank’s language in legal proceedings reflect meaningful changes in its financial or legal state?

Vector Representations (Embeddings) Using FinBERT

What are Embeddings?
	•	Embeddings are numerical vector representations of text, where similar text has similar vector representations. They allow us to compare words, sentences, or documents in terms of meaning, making it possible to apply mathematical operations to language data.

Why Use FinBERT?
	•	FinBERT is a specialized version of BERT, a language model trained on financial documents. Since it’s tuned for the finance domain, it understands financial terminology and context better than general language models.
	•	In our case, FinBERT helps convert each section of a bank’s 10-K reports into embeddings that capture the specific language used in financial and legal discussions.

How Embeddings Help in Outlier Detection and Clustering:
	•	By transforming each document (or chunk of a document) into an embedding, we can quantify the similarities and differences between them. This enables clustering of similar years or detecting outliers that have significantly different language or content.

Guiding Questions for the Audience:
	•	What advantage does using FinBERT have over a generic language model for financial documents?
	•	How might the meaning of text in a financial report influence whether it’s flagged as an outlier?

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

What is PCA?
	•	Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into a smaller set of uncorrelated components. It captures the directions in which the data varies the most, allowing us to focus on the most meaningful features.

Why Use PCA in Our Model?
	•	Text embeddings are high-dimensional, making direct analysis challenging and computationally expensive. PCA reduces the dimensionality of these embeddings while preserving their essential information. This allows us to visualize the data and apply clustering more effectively.
	•	In our model, we apply PCA to reduce the embeddings, retaining components that capture 95% of the data’s variance, ensuring we maintain meaningful distinctions between years or items.

Guiding Questions for the Audience:
	•	Why is it useful to reduce the dimensionality of text embeddings?
	•	How might PCA help in visualizing similarities and differences across different years?

KMeans Clustering (with Silhouette Score)

What is KMeans Clustering?
	•	KMeans is a clustering algorithm that partitions data points into a specified number of clusters (k), where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. It aims to minimize the variance within clusters, grouping similar points together.

Why Use the Silhouette Score?
	•	The Silhouette Score measures how well-separated clusters are. It ranges from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating well-separated clusters. In our model, we use the Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring that groups of years are meaningfully distinct.

How Clustering Enhances Our Analysis:
	•	Clustering reveals patterns within a bank’s historical data, showing how certain years or items group together based on similarity. In EagleBank’s case, clustering reveals that the years flagged as outliers form two distinct clusters, highlighting differences in the nature of the legal proceedings.

Guiding Questions for the Audience:
	•	What insights can we gain by grouping similar years together?
	•	How does clustering help us understand the nuances within outlier years?

Robust Mahalanobis Distance Using Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD)

What is Mahalanobis Distance?
	•	Mahalanobis Distance is a measure that calculates the distance between a point and the mean of a dataset, taking into account the data’s variance. This makes it effective for detecting outliers in multivariate data.

Why Use the Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD)?
	•	MCD is a robust estimator of covariance, designed to be resilient to outliers in the data. By using MCD, we calculate the Mahalanobis Distance in a way that’s less influenced by extreme values, improving accuracy in outlier detection.

Application in Our Model:
	•	After checking for normality, we use Mahalanobis Distance to measure how far each year deviates from the mean, specifically in cases where normality holds. Years with high distances are flagged as outliers, indicating significant deviations in content or tone.

Guiding Questions for the Audience:
	•	How does Mahalanobis Distance improve upon simpler distance measures for outlier detection?
	•	Why is it important to use a robust covariance estimator when identifying outliers?

Summary

These explanations cover the purpose, mechanics, and specific role of each method in your outlier detection model. By asking guiding questions, you invite the audience to think critically about why these methods are appropriate for your use case with EagleBank’s data. This approach not only clarifies each concept but also connects them to the practical objectives of your model.
